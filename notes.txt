Java OOP -OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming
- Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction

Inheritance - In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

              subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
              superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
              To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.


 Polymorphism - Has Overloading and overriding
                Overlaoding - We have multiple methods with same name but different arguments/parameters

                OverRiding - In Java, method overriding occurs when a subclass (child class) has the same method
                as the parent class. In other words, method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a particular
                implementation of a method declared by one of its parent classes
                - Same method name in Parent and child class with same arguments/parameters but different body


  Encapsulation - We have 4 different types of Access modifier in Java
                1. Public, Private, Protected, default


Inheritance.Inheritance lets programmers create new classes that share
some of the attributes of existing classes.
Using Inheritance lets us build on previous work without reinventing the wheel.
